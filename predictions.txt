All good things come to those who wait.   
Something will change today.
You might get to "show off" a little.
Try to keep your peace today.
Be a little humble today.
Remember it takes two to tango.
It will be nice to do a good deed.
Today is not a good day to fight.
Take it easy today.
Try not to take yourself too seriously.
Take steps to get what you want.
Your parents might need your attention.
