# horoscope_TCP
server runs indefinitely while chat clients connect to the server, input a zodiac sign, and receive a horoscope

1) must run on Linux (ubuntu virtualbox is what i used)
2) must run server before clients connect
3) clients can type TERMINATE or terminate or Terminate to end the server
4) typing a non-zodiac will result in no horoscope being given
